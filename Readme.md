<p> Russia has invaded Ukraine. Millions of civilians are caught in the middle of an escalating war and humanitarian crisis, and casualties are rising. The COVID-19 pandemic is an added challenge for communities where violence and uncertainty takes a heavy toll. </p>

<p> Funds collected from donors on Yodha will support Ukrainians in need, with a focus on the most vulnerable, including children and senior citizens, without revealing the personal details of the civilians. When a donor makes a donation against a hospital on the website, the donation is received by them and distributed in a decentralised manner to the patients in need. The patients can then buy the medical services and medicines they need by using the Y-Coins. The donors can also check the genuinity of the website cryptographically and also track the blockchain transactions to ensure that their donation has been used for the cause donated. </p>
